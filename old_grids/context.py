"""The context in which OLDGRIDS is used

   This module controls global parameters that are purely technical, e.g. the
   location of data files. It is certainly not meant to keep track of input
   parameters for a computation.

   This module contains a context object, an instance of the :class:`Context`
   class. For now, its functionality is rather limited. It tries to figure
   out the location of the data directory. If it is not specified in the
   environment variable ``OLDGRIDSDATA``, it is assumed that the data is located
   in a directory called ``data``. If the data directory does not exist, an
   error is raised.
