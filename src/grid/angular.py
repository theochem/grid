Angular grid module for constructing integration grids on the unit sphere.

The Lebedev grid points used were obtained from the theochem/HORTON package.
Their calculations were based on F77 translation by Dr. Christoph van Wuellen
and these are the comments from that translation.

This subroutine is part of a set of subroutines that generate
Lebedev grids [1]_ [2]_ [3]_ [4]_ [5]_ [6]_ for integration on a sphere. The original
C-code [1]_ was kindly provided by Dr. Dmitri N. Laikov and
translated into Fortran by Dr. Christoph van Wuellen.
This subroutine was translated from C to fortran77 by hand.
Users of this code are asked to include reference [1]_ in their
publications, and in the user- and programmers-manuals
describing their codes.
This code was distributed through CCL (http://www.ccl.net/).

The symmetric spherical t-design were obtained from reference [7]_.

    This class numerically evaluates the surface integral of a function

    .. math::
        \int_{S^2} f d\Omega  = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi f(\theta, \phi) \sin(\phi)
         d\theta d\phi \approx \sum_{i}^{N} w_i f(\phi_i, \theta_i),

    where :math:`S^2` is the unit-sphere parameterized by the quadrature points
    :math:`\theta_i \in [0, 2\pi]` and :math:`\phi_i \in [0, \pi)`\, and
    :math:`w_{i}` are the weights of the :math:`N` quadrature points. The
    :math:`4\pi` normalization factor present in the original quadrature scheme
    is included in the integration weights.

    Two types of angular grids are supported: Lebedev-Laikov grid and symmetric
    spherical t-design. Specifically, for spherical t-design, the weights are constant
    value of :math:`4 \pi / N`\, where :math:`N` is the number of points in the grid.
    The weights are chosen so that the spherical harmonics are normalized.

        Notes

        - Sometimes the weights for Lebedev-Laikov grids can be negative. Choosing degrees that have
          positive weights can mitigate round-off errors. Degrees equal to 13, 25 or 27 have
          negative weights. See https://github.com/theochem/grid/issues/158.

        Load the .npz file containing the pre-computed angular grid points and weights.

        Parameters
        ----------
        degree : int
            Maximum angular degree :math:`l` of spherical harmonics that the angular grid
            can integrate accurately.
        size : int
            Number of angular grid points.
        method: str
            Method for constructing the angular grid. Options are "lebedev" (for Lebedev-Laikov)
