Angular grid module for constructing integration grids on the unit sphere.

The Lebedev grid points used were obtained from the theochem/HORTON package.
Their calculations were based on F77 translation by Dr. Christoph van Wuellen
and these are the comments from that translation.

This subroutine is part of a set of subroutines that generate
Lebedev grids [1-6]_ for integration on a sphere. The original
C-code [1]_ was kindly provided by Dr. Dmitri N. Laikov and
translated into Fortran by Dr. Christoph van Wuellen.
This subroutine was translated from C to fortran77 by hand.
Users of this code are asked to include reference [1]_ in their
publications, and in the user- and programmers-manuals
describing their codes.
This code was distributed through CCL (http://www.ccl.net/).

The symmetric spherical t-design were obtained from reference [7]_.

    r"""Angular grid for integrating functions on the unit sphere.

    This class numerically evaluates the integral of a function
    :math:`f: S^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}` on the unit-sphere as follows:

    .. math::
        \int_{S^2} f   = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi f(\theta, \phi) \sin(\phi)
         d\theta d\phi \approx \sum_{i}^{N} w_i f(\phi_i, \theta_i),

    where :math:`S^2` is the unit-sphere, :math:`\theta_i \in [0, 2\pi]`
    and :math:`\phi_i \in [0, \pi)` and quadrature points and :math:`w^{ang}_i`
    are the quadrature weights of :math:`N` grid points.

    Two types of angular grids are supported: Lebedev-Laikov grid and symmetric
    spherical t-design. Specifically, for spherical t-design, the weights are constant
    value of :math:`4 \pi / N`, where :math:`N` is the number of points in the grid.
    The weights are chosen so that the spherical harmonics are normalized.

        Three choices to construct this grid:

           integrate accurately on a unit sphere.
        3. The number of points (size) wanted in the grid. The size corresponds
           to a maximum degree.

        Parameters
        ----------
        points : ndarray(N, 3), optional
            The Cartesian coordinates of grid points.  The attribute
            `weights` should also be provided.
        weights : ndarray(N,), optional
            The weights of each point on the integral quadrature grid. The attribute
            `points` should also be applied.
        degree : int, optional
            Maximum angular degree :math:`l` of spherical harmonics that the grid
            can integrate accurately. If the grid corresponding to the given angular
            degree is not supported, the next largest degree is used.
        size : int, optional
            Number of grid points. If the grid corresponding to the given size is
            not supported, the next largest size is used. If both degree and size are given,
            degree is used for constructing the grid.
        cache : bool, optional
            If True, then store the points and weights of the AngularGrid in cache
            to avoid duplicate grids that have the same `degree`.
        use_spherical: bool, optional
            If False, the Lebedev-Laikov angular grid is used. If True, the symmetric spherical
            t-design angular grid are used.

        Returns
        -------
        AngularGrid
            An angular grid with points and weights on a unit sphere.

        Notes
        -----
        - Sometimes the weights for Lebedev-Laikov grids can be negative. Choosing degrees that have
          positive weights can mitigate round-off errors. Degrees equal to 13, 25 or 27 have
          negative weights. See https://github.com/theochem/grid/issues/158.

        Load the .npz file containing the pre-computed angular grid points and weights.

        Either loads Lebedev-Laikov grid or the symmetric spherical t-design grid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        degree : int
            Maximum angular degree :math:`l` of spherical harmonics that the angular grid
            can integrate accurately.
        size : int
            Number of angular grid points. If the angular grid corresponding to the given size is
            not supported, the next largest size is used.
        use_spherical: bool, optional
            If False, the Lebedev-Laikov angular grid is used. If True, the symmetric spherical
            t-design angular grid are used.

        Returns
        -------
        (ndarray(N, 3), ndarray(N,))
            The three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates & weights of :math:`N` grid
            points on a unit sphere.
