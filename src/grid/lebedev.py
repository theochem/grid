Lebedev angular grid module for constructing integration grids on the unit sphere.

The Lebedev grid points here were obtained and calculated from the theochem/HORTON package.
Their calculations were based on F77 translation by Dr. Christoph van Wuellen
and these are the comments from that translation.

This subroutine is part of a set of subroutines that generate
Lebedev grids [1-6] for integration on a sphere. The original
C-code [1] was kindly provided by Dr. Dmitri N. Laikov and
translated into fortran by Dr. Christoph van Wuellen.
This subroutine was translated from C to fortran77 by hand.
Users of this code are asked to include reference [1] in their
publications, and in the user- and programmers-manuals
describing their codes.
This code was distributed through CCL (http://www.ccl.net/).

    This class numerically evaluates the integral of a function
    :math:`f: S^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}` on the unit-sphere as follows:

    .. math::
        4 \pi \int_{S^2} f d\Sigma  = 4\pi \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} f(\theta, \phi) \sin(\theta)

    where :math:`S^2` is the unit-sphere,
    :math:`w^{ang}_i` are the quadrature weights that includes :math:`4\pi`.

    The weights are chosen so that the spherical harmonics integrate to :math:`4\pi`:

    .. math::
        \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} Y^l_m(\theta, \phi) \sin(\theta) d\theta d\phi = 4\pi.

        Three choices to construct this grid:

        1. Add your own points and weights.
        2. Specify maximum degree of spherical harmonics that Lebedev grid can
           integrate accurately on a unit sphere.
        3. The number of points (size) wanted in the grid. The size corresponds
           to a maximum degree.

        Parameters
        ----------
        points : ndarray(N, 3), optional
            The Cartesian coordinates of integral grid points.  The attribute
            `weights` should also be provided.
        weights : ndarray(N,), optional
            The weights of each point on the integral quadrature grid. The attribute
            `points` should also be applied.
        degree : int, optional
            Maximum angular degree :math:`l` of spherical harmonics that the Lebedev grid
            can integrate accurately. If the Lebedev grid corresponding to the given angular
            degree is not supported, the next largest degree is used.
        size : int, optional
            Number of Lebedev grid points. If the Lebedev grid corresponding to the given size is
            not supported, the next largest size is used. If both degree and size are given,
            degree is used for constructing the grid.
        cache : bool, optional
            If true, then store the points and weights of the AngularGrid in cache
            to avoid duplicate grids that have the same `degree`. Default to `True`.
