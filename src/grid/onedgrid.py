def GaussLaguerre(npoints, alpha=0):
    r"""Generate 1D grid on [0, inf) interval based on Generalized Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.

    The fundamental definition of Generalized Gauss-Laguerre quadrature is:

    .. math::
        \int_{0}^{\infty} x^\alpha e^{-x} f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i)

    However, to integrate function :math:`g(x)` over [0, inf), this is re-written as:

    .. math::
        \int_{0}^{\infty} g(x)dx \approx
        \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{w_i}{x_i^\alpha e^{-x_i}} g(x_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i' g(x_i)

    Parameters
    ----------
    npoints : int
        Number of grid points.
    alpha : float, optional
        Value of parameter :math:`alpha` which should be larger than -1.

    Returns
    -------
    OneDGrid
        A 1D grid instance.

    The fundamental definition of Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature is:

    Parameters
    ----------
