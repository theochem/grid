class MultiDomainGrid(Grid):
    r"""
    Grid class for integrating functions of multiple variables, each defined on a different grid.

    This class facilitates the numerical integration of functions with :math:`N` arguments
    over a corresponding :math:`N`-dimensional domain using grid-based methods.

    .. math::
        \int \cdots \int f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N) \, dx_1 dx_2 \cdots dx_N

    The function to integrate must accept arguments :math:`\{x_i\}` that correspond to
    the dimensions (point-wise) of the respective grids. Specifically:

        - Each argument :math:`x_i` corresponds to a different grid.
        - The dimensionality of each argument must match the dimensionality of a point of its
          associated grid.

    For example:

    - For a function of the form :code:`f([x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2]) -> float`,
      the first argument corresponds to a 3-dimensional grid, and the second argument
      corresponds to a 2-dimensional grid.


    The function to integrate must have all arguments :math:`\{x_i\}` with the same dimension as the
    points of the corresponding grids (i.e. each of the arguments corresponds to a different grid).
    For example for a function of the form f((x1,y1,z1), (x2,y2)) -> float the first argument must
    be described by a 3D grid and the second argument by a 2D grid.
    """

    def __init__(self, grid_list=None, num_domains=None):
        r"""
        Initialize the MultiDomainGrid grid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_list : list of Grid
            A list of Grid objects, where each Grid corresponds to a separate argument
            (integration domain) of the function to be integrated.

            - At least one grid must be specified.
            - The number of elements in `grid_list` should match the number of arguments
              in the target function.

        num_domains : int, optional
            The number of integration domains.

            - This parameter is optional and can only be specified when `grid_list` contains
              exactly one grid.
            - It must be a positive integer greater than 1.
            - If specified, the function to integrate is considered to have `num_domains` arguments,
              all defined over the same grid (i.e., the same set of points is used for each
              argument).

        MultiDomainGrid
            A MultiDomainGrid object.

        Integrate callable on the N particle grid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        integrand : callable
            Integrand function to integrate. It must take a list of arguments (one for each domain)
            with the same dimension as the grid points used for the corresponding domain and return

            Number of points to integrate at once. This parameter can be used to control the
            memory usage of the integration. Default is 1000.
        non_vectorized : bool, optional
            Set to True if the integrand is not vectorized. Default is False. If True, the integrand
            will be called for each point of the grid separately without vectorization. This implies
            a slower integration. Use this option if the integrand is not vectorized.
