"""Conversion from and to atomic units

   Internally OLDGRIDS always uses atomic units. Atomic units are consistent,
   similar to the SI unit system: one does not need conversion factors in the
   middle of a computation. This choice facilitates the programming and reduces
   accidental bugs.

   References for the conversion values:

   * B. J. Mohr and B. N. Taylor,
     CODATA recommended values of the fundamental physical
     constants: 1998, Rev. Mod. Phys. 72(2), 351 (2000)
   * The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty
     (http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html)
   * 1 calorie = 4.184 Joules

   **Conventions followed by this module:**

   Let foo be is the value of an external unit in internal (atomic) units. The
   way to use this unit is as follows: ``5*foo`` litterally means `five times
   foo`. The result of this operation is a floating point number for this value
   in atomic units.

   **Examples:**

   If you want to have a distance of five angstrom in internal units:
   ``5*angstrom``.

   If you want to convert a length of 5 internal units to angstrom:
   ``5/angstrom``.

   **Remarks:**

   It is highly recommended to perform unit conversions only when data is read
   from the input or data is written to the output. It may also be useful in
   `input scripts` that use OLDGRIDS. Do not perform any unit conversion in other
   parts of the program.

   An often recurring question is how to convert a frequency in internal units
   to a spectroscopic wavenumber in inverse centimeters. This is how it can be
   done::

     >>> from horton import centimeter, lightspeed
     >>> invcm = lightspeed/centimeter
     >>> freq = 0.00320232
     >>> print freq/invcm

   These are the conversion constants defined in this module:
