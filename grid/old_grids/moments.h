/** @brief Compute Cartesian mononomials efficiently.

    Computes all Cartesian mononomials (x, y, z) up to a given order in alphabetical
    order. The first three elements of output must contain x, y and z.

    @param output
        The output array, which must be sufficiently large.

    @param lmax
        The highest order of the mononomials.

    @returns The position of the first mononomial of the highest order.
