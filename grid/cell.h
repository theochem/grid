// UPDATELIBDOCTITLE: Unit cell code to specify periodic boundary conditions

#ifndef GRID_CELL_H
#define GRID_CELL_H

/** @brief
        3D/2D/1D periodic boundary conditions and derived quantities.

    Upon construction, an object of this class acts as a read-only
    representation of the periodic boundary conditions. Reciprocal cell vectors,
    vector lengths and spacings between planes are computed immediately. All
    sorts of manipulations of fractional/Cartesian coordinates are supported.

    Note that this implementation is specific for 3D systems, eventhough lower-
    dimensional periodic boundary conditions are supported. In case of 1D or 2D
    PBC, the cell vectors are internally extended with orthogonal basis vectors
    to guarantee an invertible transformation between cartesian and fractional
    coordinates.
