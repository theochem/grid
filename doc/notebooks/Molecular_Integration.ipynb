This angular grid is usually defined by the degree $l$ of which spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}$ it can integrate accurately.  Thus each radial points $r_i$ is associated with an angular grid that can integrate up to degree $l$ of the spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}$.

    "2. MolGrid.from_preset(): Generates atomic grid for each center based on the atomic numbers, atomic coordinates, a radial grid to integrate over $[0, \\infty)$, and a preset parameter from the list [\"coarse\", \"medium\", \"fine\", \"veryfine\", \"ultrafine\", \"insane\"] that controls the degree of the angular grid.\n",
    "3. MolGrid.from_size(): Similar to from_preset method but instead of string preset parameter, it has an integer size which controls the size of the angular grid inside the atomic grid class.\n",
    "4. MolGrid.from_prune(): Gives more control to the size of the angular grid based on the radius.  This is done by providing `r_sectors` list and `sector_degs` that controls what kind of angular grid to place at each radius point. This is useful for placing lower degree angular grids close to the nucleus and larger degree angular grids further away.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step here is to generate an one-dimensional grid to integrate over the radial coordinate $r \\in [0, \\infty)$.  This is done by constructing a Trapezoidal grid over $[-1, 1]$ and using the Becke Transformation to transform it to $[0, \\infty)$.\n"
