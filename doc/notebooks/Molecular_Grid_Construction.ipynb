[MolGrid.from_preset()](../pyapi/grid.molgrid.rst#grid.molgrid.MolGrid.from_preset): Generates atomic grid for each center based on the atomic numbers, atomic coordinates, a radial grid to integrate over $[0, \\infty)$, and a preset parameter from the list [\"coarse\", \"medium\", \"fine\", \"veryfine\", \"ultrafine\", \"insane\"] that controls the degree of the angular grid.\n",
